# Windows-UWP-APP
<h1>3rd year Mobile applications Project built using c# and visual studio 2015 </h1>
<br> 
<h2>SoundBoard App</h2>
<br>
This repository contains code and information for a third-year undergraduate project for the module Mobile Applications 2 
That I am currently undertaking
<br>
<h4><b>Project Overview</b></h4> 

Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage
and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. These include:
 Accelerometer or Gyroscope
 GPS (Location Based Services)
 Sound
 Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)
 Camera
 Multi Touch Gesture Management

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the question
“why will the user open this app for a second time?”

<h4>Submission:</h4>
On Windows Store
Your Apps must be submitted for certification on the Windows Store in order to be considered for marking

<h4>Funtionality</h4>
<br>The soundBoard App is very self explanatory to use the you can do it one of two ways
<br>1.Download the full project as a zip via the github account :

<br>2.Navigate to the windows Store and Download the app on your tablet,Laptop Desktop or Mobile Device

<h4>About App</h4>
<p><i>The App that I chose to create using Windows UWP is a simple Soundboard App. 
The reason I chose this type App was it was relatively not to complex to implement and was something I had been thinking of doing on a different programming language in my spare time.</i></p>
